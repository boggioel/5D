	<p1 style="font-size: 25px;margin: 5px;font-family: arial">Last fall, I spent four months in Rome, Italy. Being in such a different environment and culture exposed me to so many things that I eventually fell in love with. One of the things I fell in love with was the Italian "piazza." The piazza is a place where locals (and visitors) spend their time eating at a cafe, sipping on espresso, or just wandering around. This open space gave a sense of freedom in a city with such narrow, winding streets. My daily commute required me to walk through said piazzas ("piazze", technically speaking). One of the most famous piazzas in Italy is Piazza Navona. This piazza is famous for its history, location, and beautiful fountain, the "Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi." Many Italian piazzas home beautiful fountains and/or sculptures. When being assigned this project, I immediately recalled the Italian piazza and I thought "how funny would it be if the mug was the fountain?" Thus, my idea was born. The mug will replace the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi in Piazza Navona. It will simply be filled with the same pure Roman water, drawn from the aqueducts. I didn't have much of a thought process behind this idea because it kind of just popped into my head. I think viewers would understand its placement because like a traditional fountain, a mug also commonly holds water. The mug is also a staple in the Italian household, which I think appeals to locals. I think doing this encourages imagination and thought among daily objects; viewers might question what other uses a mug (dependent on size) may have.
